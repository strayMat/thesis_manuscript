              and developmental difficulties that can impose large costs
              on society. However, estimates of the return to
              LBW-prevention from cross-sectional associations may be
              biased by omitted variables, such as genetic factors. To
              address this, we compare the hospital costs, health at
              birth, and infant mortality rates between heavier and
              lighter infants from all twin pairs born in the United
              States. We also examine the effect of maternal smoking
              during pregnancy—the leading risk factor for LBW in the
              United States—on health among singleton births after
              controlling for detailed background characteristics. Both
              analyses imply substantially smaller effects of LBW per se
              than previously thought, suggesting two possibilities: 1)
              existing estimates overstate the true costs and
              consequences of LBW by at least a factor of four and by as
              much as a factor of twenty; or 2) different LBW-preventing
              interventions have different health and cost consequences,
              implying that policy efforts that presume a single return
              to reducing LBW will be suboptimal.},

                U.S. hospitals, there is concern that an “advanced use”
                digital divide exists between critical access hospitals
                (CAHs) and non-CAHs. We measured EHR adoption and advanced
                use over time to analyzed changes in the divide.We used
                2008 to 2018 American Hospital Association Information
                Technology survey data to update national EHR adoption
                statistics. We stratified EHR adoption by CAH status and
                measured advanced use for both patient engagement (PE) and
                clinical data analytics (CDA) domains. We used a linear
                probability regression for each domain with year-CAH
                interactions to measure temporal changes in the
                relationship between CAH status and advanced use.In 2018,
                98.3\% of hospitals had adopted EHRs; there were no
                differences by CAH status. A total of 58.7\% and 55.6\% of
                hospitals adopted advanced PE and CDA functions,
                respectively. In both domains, CAHs were less likely to be
                advanced users: 46.6\% demonstrated advanced use for PE and
                32.0\% for CDA. Since 2015, the advanced use divide has
                persisted for PE and widened for CDA.EHR adoption among
                hospitals is essentially ubiquitous; however, CAHs still
                lag behind in advanced use functions critical to improving
                care quality. This may be rooted in different advanced use
                needs among CAH patients and lack of access to technical
                expertise.The advanced use divide prevents CAH patients
                from benefitting from a fully digitized healthcare system.
                To close the widening gap in CDA, policymakers should
                consider partnering with vendors to develop implementation
                guides and standards for functions like dashboards and
                high-risk patient identification algorithms to better

                  be used to fit any quantity of interest identified as the
                  solution to a set of local moment equations. Following the
                  literature on local maximum likelihood estimation, our
                  method considers a weighted set of nearby training
                  examples; however, instead of using classical kernel
                  weighting functions that are prone to a strong curse of
                  dimensionality, we use an adaptive weighting function
                  derived from a forest designed to express heterogeneity in

               data to learn a treatment assignment policy that satisﬁes
               application-speciﬁc constraints, such as budget,
               fairness, simplicity, or other functional form constraints.
               For example, policies may be restricted to take the form of
               decision trees based on a limited set of easily observable
               individual characteristics. We propose a new approach to
               this problem motivated by the theory of semiparametrically
               eﬃcient estimation. Our method can be used to optimize
               either binary treatments or inﬁnitesimal nudges to
               continuous treatments, and can leverage observational data
               where causal eﬀects are identiﬁed using a variety of
               strategies, including selection on observables and
               instrumental variables. Given a doubly robust estimator of
               the causal eﬀect of assigning everyone to treatment, we
               develop an algorithm for choosing whom to treat, and
               establish strong guarantees for the asymptotic utilitarian

                  of treatment received creates a synthetic sample in which
                  treatment assignment is independent of measured baseline
                  covariates. Inverse probability of treatment weighting
                  ({IPTW}) using the propensity score allows one to obtain
                  unbiased estimates of average treatment effects. However,
                  these estimates are only valid if there are no residual
                  systematic differences in observed baseline characteristics
                  between treated and control subjects in the sample weighted
                  by the estimated inverse probability of treatment. We
                  report on a systematic literature review, in which we found
                  that the use of {IPTW} has increased rapidly in recent
                  years, but that in the most recent year, a majority of
                  studies did not formally examine whether weighting balanced
                  measured covariates between treatment groups. We then
                  proceed to describe a suite of quantitative and qualitative
                  methods that allow one to assess whether measured baseline
                  covariates are balanced between treatment groups in the
                  weighted sample. The quantitative methods use the weighted
                  standardized difference to compare means, prevalences,
                  higher‐order moments, and interactions. The qualitative
                  methods employ graphical methods to compare the
                  distribution of continuous baseline covariates between
                  treated and control subjects in the weighted sample.
                  Finally, we illustrate the application of these methods in
                  an empirical case study. We propose a formal set of balance
                  diagnostics that contribute towards an evolving concept of
                  ‘best practice’ when using {IPTW} to estimate causal

                dramatic transformation taking place in health informatics
                in large part because of the new Health Level 7 ({HL}7)
                Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ({FHIR})
                standard. The first article provided background on health
                care, electronic health record systems for physicians, and
                the challenges they both face along with the potential of
                interoperability to help overcome them. The second
                introduced the basics of the {FHIR} standard and some
                suggested resources for those who are interested in its
                further exploration. The third introduced {SMART} on {FHIR}
                which, based on its wide adoption, has become the default
                standard {FHIR} app platform. The fourth looked at clinical
                decision support, arguably the single most important
                providerfacing use case for {FHIR}. The fifth introduced
                the personal health record and tools that can utilize the
                data stored in it as an important use case for {FHIR} in
                support of patients. This article looks at the future uses
                of {FHIR} with a particular emphasis on those that might
                impact on research uses of health data. The articles in

  title    = {Characterizing clinical pediatric obesity subtypes using
              electronic health record data},
  volume   = {1},
  abstract = {In this work, we present a study of electronic health
              record (EHR) data that aims to identify pediatric obesity
              clinical subtypes. Specifically, we examine whether certain
              temporal condition patterns associated with childhood
              obesity incidence tend to cluster together to characterize
              subtypes of clinically similar patients. In a previous
              study, the sequence mining algorithm, SPADE was implemented
              on EHR data from a large retrospective cohort (n = 49 594
              patients) to identify common condition trajectories
              surrounding pediatric obesity incidence. In this study, we
              used Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to identify potential
              subtypes formed by these temporal condition patterns. The
              demographic characteristics of patients in each subtype are
              also examined. An LCA model with 8 classes was developed
              that identified clinically similar patient subtypes.
              Patients in Class 1 had a high prevalence of respiratory
              and sleep disorders, patients in Class 2 had high rates of
              inflammatory skin conditions, patients in Class 3 had a
              high prevalence of seizure disorders, and patients in Class
              4 had a high prevalence of Asthma. Patients in Class 5
              lacked a clear characteristic morbidity pattern, and
              patients in Classes 6, 7, and 8 had a high prevalence of
              gastrointestinal issues, neurodevelopmental disorders, and
              physical symptoms respectively. Subjects generally had high
              membership probability for a single class
              ({\textgreater}70\%), suggesting shared clinical
              characterization within the individual groups. We
              identified patient subtypes with temporal condition
              patterns that are significantly more common among obese
              pediatric patients using a Latent Class Analysis approach.
              Our findings may be used to characterize the prevalence of
              common conditions among newly obese pediatric patients and
              to identify pediatric obesity subtypes. The identified
              subtypes align with prior knowledge on comorbidities
              associated with childhood obesity, including
              gastro-intestinal, dermatologic, developmental, and sleep
              disorders, as well as asthma.},

                consists of thick cardboard, containing perforated holes
                specifying the musical notes. We propose to represent
                clinical time-dependent data in a tabular form inspired
                from this principle. The sheet represents a statistical
                individual, each row represents a binary time-dependent
                variable, and each hole denotes the "true" value. Data from
                electronic health records or nationwide
                medical-administrative databases can then be represented:
                demographics, patient flow, drugs, laboratory results,
                diagnoses, and procedures. This data representation is
                suitable for survival analysis (e.g., Cox model with
                repeated outcomes and changing covariates) and different
                types of temporal association rules. Quantitative
                continuous variables can be discretized, as in clinical
                studies. The "book music" approach could become an
                intermediary step in feature extraction from structured
                data. It would enable to better account for time in
                analyses, notably for historical cohort analyses based on

  abstract     = {Estimation of average treatment effects under unconfounded
                  or ignorable treatment assignment is often hampered by lack
                  of overlap in the covariate distributions between treatment
                  groups. This lack of overlap can lead to imprecise
                  estimates, and can make commonly used estimators sensitive
                  to the choice of specification. In such cases researchers
                  have often used ad hoc methods for trimming the sample. We
                  develop a systematic approach to addressing lack of
                  overlap. We characterize optimal subsamples for which the
                  average treatment effect can be estimated most precisely.
                  Under some conditions, the optimal selection rules depend
                  solely on the propensity score. For a wide range of
                  distributions, a good approximation to the optimal rule is
                  provided by the simple rule of thumb to discard all units

              at {ML} Benchmarking Practices in Treatment Effect
              Estimation},
  abstract = {The machine learning ({ML}) toolbox for estimation of
              heterogeneous treatment effects from observational data is
              expanding rapidly, yet many of its algorithms have been
              evaluated only on a very limited set of semi-synthetic
              benchmark datasets. In this paper, we investigate current
              benchmarking practices for {ML}-based conditional average
              treatment effect ({CATE}) estimators, with special focus on
              empirical evaluation based on the popular semi-synthetic
              {IHDP} benchmark. We identify problems with current
              practice and highlight that semi-synthetic benchmark
              datasets, which (unlike real-world benchmarks used
              elsewhere in {ML}) do not necessarily reﬂect properties
              of real data, can systematically favor some algorithms over
              others – a fact that is rarely acknowledged but of
              immense relevance for interpretation of empirical results.
              Further, we argue that current evaluation metrics evaluate
              performance only for a small subset of possible use cases
              of {CATE} estimators, and discuss alternative metrics
              relevant for applications in personalized medicine.
              Additionally, we discuss alternatives for current benchmark
              datasets, and implications of our ﬁndings for
              benchmarking in {CATE} estimation.},

		  marketing authorization applications ({MAAs}) and
		  extensions of indication ({EOIs}) for already authorized
		  products submitted to the {EMA} in 2018 and 2019. For
		  {MAAs}, 63 of 158 products (39.9\%) contained {RWE} with a

		  {RWE} submitted was derived from data collected before the
		  planned authorization. The most common data sources were
		  registries (60.3\%) followed by hospital data (31.7\%).
		  {RWE} was mainly included to support safety (87.3\%) and
		  efficacy (49.2\%) with cohort studies being the most

  abstract = {Background and Objectives Data Quality ({DQ}) programs are
              recognized as a critical aspect of new-generation research
              platforms using electronic health record ({EHR}) data for
              building Learning Healthcare Systems. The {AP}-{HP}
              Clinical Data Repository aggregates {EHR} data from 37
              hospitals to enable large-scale research and secondary data
              analysis. This paper describes the {DQ} program currently
              in place at {AP}-{HP} and the lessons learned from two {DQ}
              campaigns initiated in 2017. Materials and Methods As part
              of the {AP}-{HP} {DQ} program, two domains - patient
              identification ({PI}) and healthcare services ({HS}) - were
              selected for conducting {DQ} campaigns consisting of 5
              phases: defining the scope, measuring, analyzing, improving
              and controlling {DQ}. Semi-automated {DQ} profiling was
              conducted in two data sets – the {PI} data set containing
              8.8 M patients and the {HS} data set containing 13,099
              consultation agendas and 2122 care units. Seventeen {DQ}
              measures were defined and {DQ} issues were classified using
              a unified {DQ} reporting framework. For each domain,
              actions plans were defined for improving and monitoring
              prioritized {DQ} issues. Results Eleven identified {DQ}
              issues (8 for the {PI} data set and 3 for the {HS} data
              set) were categorized into completeness (n = 6),
              conformance (n = 3) and plausibility (n = 2) {DQ}
              issues. {DQ} issues were caused by errors from data
              originators, {ETL} issues or limitations of the {EHR} data
              entry tool. The action plans included sixteen actions (9
              for the {PI} domain and 7 for the {HS} domain). Though only
              partial implementation, the {DQ} campaigns already resulted
              in significant improvement of {DQ} measures. Conclusion
              {DQ} assessments of hospital information systems are
              largely unpublished. The preliminary results of two {DQ}
              campaigns conducted at {AP}-{HP} illustrate the benefit of
              the engagement into a {DQ} program. The adoption of a
              unified {DQ} reporting framework enables the communication
              of {DQ} findings in a well-defined manner with a shared
              vocabulary. Dedicated tooling is needed to automate and
              extend the scope of the generic {DQ} program. Specific {DQ}
              checks will be additionally defined on a per-study basis to
              evaluate whether {EHR} data fits for specific uses.},

  abstract   = {Statisticians have made great progress in creating methods
                that reduce our reliance on parametric assumptions. However
                this explosion in research has resulted in a breadth of
                inferential strategies that both create opportunities for
                more reliable inference as well as complicate the choices
                that an applied researcher has to make and defend.
                Relatedly, researchers advocating for new methods typically
                compare their method to at best 2 or 3 other causal
                inference strategies and test using simulations that may or
                may not be designed to equally tease out flaws in all the
                competing methods. The causal inference data analysis
                challenge, "Is Your {SATT} Where It's At?", launched as
                part of the 2016 Atlantic Causal Inference Conference,
                sought to make progress with respect to both of these
                issues. The researchers creating the data testing grounds
                were distinct from the researchers submitting methods whose
                efficacy would be evaluated. Results from 30 competitors
                across the two versions of the competition (black box
                algorithms and do-it-yourself analyses) are presented along
                with post-hoc analyses that reveal information about the
                characteristics of causal inference strategies and settings
                that affect performance. The most consistent conclusion was
                that methods that flexibly model the response surface
                perform better overall than methods that fail to do so.
                Finally new methods are proposed that combine features of
                several of the top-performing submitted methods.},

                longitudinal observational study comparing data from

  volume     = {131},
  shorttitle = {Diffusion dynamics of electronic health records},
  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: While aiming for the same goal of building a
                national eHealth Infrastructure, Germany and the United
                States pursued different strategic approaches -
                particularly regarding the role of promoting the adoption
                and usage of hospital Electronic Health Records (EHR).
                OBJECTIVE: To measure and model the diffusion dynamics of
                EHRs in German hospital care and to contrast the results
                with the developments in the US. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All
                acute care hospitals that were members of the German
                statutory health system were surveyed during the period
                2007-2017 for EHR adoption. Bass models were computed based
                on the German data and the corresponding data of the
                American Hospital Association (AHA) from non-federal
                hospitals in order to model and explain the diffusion of
                innovation. RESULTS: While the diffusion dynamics observed
                in the US resembled the typical s-shaped curve with high
                imitation effects (q = 0.583) but with a relatively low
                innovation effect (p = 0.025), EHR diffusion in Germany
                stagnated with adoption rates of approx. 50\% (imitation
                effect q = -0.544) despite a higher innovation effect
                (p = 0.303). DISCUSSION: These findings correlate with
                different governmental strategies in the US and Germany of
                financially supporting EHR adoption. Imitation only seems
                to work if there are financial incentives, e.g. those of
                the HITECH Act in the US. They are lacking in Germany,
                where the government left health IT adoption strategies
                solely to the free market and the consensus among all of
                the stakeholders. CONCLUSION: Bass diffusion models proved
                to be useful for distinguishing the diffusion dynamics in
                German and US non-federal hospitals. When applying the Bass
                model, the imitation parameter needs a broader
                interpretation beyond the network effects, including
                driving forces such as incentives and regulations, as was
                demonstrated by this study.},

              forests; second, we formulate the matching problem as an
              average minimum-cost flow problem and provide an efficient
              algorithm; third, we propose a match-then-split principle
              for the assessment with cross-validation. We demonstrate
              the efficacy of the assessment approach using simulations

  abstract   = {Objective In the context of rare diseases, it may be
                helpful to detect patients with similar medical histories,
                diagnoses and outcomes from a large number of cases with
                automated methods. To reduce the time to find new cases, we
                developed a method to find similar patients given an index
                case leveraging data from the electronic health records.
                Materials and methods We used the clinical data warehouse
                of a children academic hospital in Paris, France
                (Necker-Enfants Malades), containing about 400,000
                patients. Our model was based on a vector space model
                ({VSM}) to compute the similarity distance between an index
                patient and all the patients of the data warehouse. The
                dimensions of the {VSM} were built upon Unified Medical
                Language System concepts extracted from clinical narratives
                stored in the clinical data warehouse. The {VSM} was
                enhanced using three parameters: a pertinence score
                ({TF}-{IDF} of the concepts), the polarity of the concept
                (negated/not negated) and the minimum number of concepts in
                common. We evaluated this model by displaying the most
                similar patients for five different rare diseases: Lowe
                Syndrome ({LOWE}), Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa
                ({DEB}), Activated {PI}3K delta Syndrome ({APDS}), Rett
                Syndrome ({RETT}) and Dowling Meara ({EBS}-{DM}), from the
                clinical data warehouse representing 18, 103, 21, 84 and 7
                patients respectively. Results The percentages of index
                patients returning at least one true positive similar
                patient in the Top30 similar patients were 94\% for {LOWE},
                97\% for {DEB}, 86\% for {APDS}, 71\% for {EBS}-{DM} and
                99\% for {RETT}. The mean number of patients with the exact
                same genetic diseases among the 30 returned patients was
                51\%. Conclusion This tool offers new perspectives in a
                translational context to identify patients for genetic
                research. Moreover, when new molecular bases are
                discovered, our strategy will help to identify additional
                eligible patients for genetic screening.},

  title        = {Causal Inference and Uplift Modeling A review of the
                  literature},
  series       = {Proceedings of Machine Learning Research},
  abstract     = {Uplift modeling refers to the set of techniques used to
                  model the incremental impact of an action or treatment on a
                  customer outcome. Uplift modeling is therefore both a
                  Causal Inference problem and a Machine Learning one. The
                  literature on uplift is split into 3 main approaches–the
                  Two-Model approach, the Class Transformation approach and
                  modeling uplift directly. Unfortunately, in the absence of
                  a common framework of causal inference and notation, it can
                  be quite di cult to assess those three methods. In this
                  paper, we use the Rubin (1974) model of causal inference
                  and its modern “econometrics” notation to provide a
                  clear comparison of the three approaches and generalize one
                  of them. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst paper that
                  provides a uniﬁed review of the uplift literature.
                  Moreover, our paper contributes to the literature by
                  showing that, in the limit, minimizing the Mean Square
                  Error ({MSE}) formula with respect to a causal e↵ect
                  estimator is equivalent to minimizing the {MSE} in which
                  the unobserved treatment e↵ect is replaced by a modiﬁed
                  target variable. Finally, we hope that our paper will be of
                  use to researchers interested in applying Machine Learning
                  techniques to causal inference problems in a business
                  context as well as in other ﬁelds: medicine, sociology or

  title    = {Bayesian Nonparametric Modeling for Causal Inference},
  abstract = {Researchers have long struggled to identify causal effects
              in nonexperimental settings. Many recently proposed
              strategies assume ignorability of the treatment assignment
              mechanism and require fitting two models—one for the
              assignment mechanism and one for the response surface. This
              article proposes a strategy that instead focuses on very
              flexibly modeling just the response surface using a
              Bayesian nonparametric modeling procedure, Bayesian
              Additive Regression Trees ({BART}). {BART} has several
              advantages: it is far simpler to use than many recent
              competitors, requires less guesswork in model fitting,
              handles a large number of predictors, yields coherent
              uncertainty intervals, and fluidly handles continuous
              treatment variables and missing data for the outcome
              variable. {BART} also naturally identifies heterogeneous
              treatment effects. {BART} produces more accurate estimates
              of average treatment effects compared to propensity score
              matching, propensity-weighted estimators, and regression
              adjustment in the nonlinear simulation situations examined.
              Further, it is highly competitive in linear settings with
              the “correct” model, linear regression. Supplemental

                  facilitate the reuse of healthcare data and leverage

                  and use for clinical research, epidemiology and health
                  service research of the “Hôpital Européen Georges
                  Pompidou” ({HEGP}) {CDW}. Methods The {CDW} has been
                  developed since 2008 using an i2b2 platform. It was made
                  available to health professionals and researchers in
                  October 2010. Procedures to access data have been
                  implemented and different access levels have been
                  distinguished according to the nature of queries. Results
                  As of July 2016, the {CDW} contained the consolidated data
                  of over 860,000 patients followed since the opening of the
                  {HEGP} hospital in July 2000. These data correspond to more
                  than 122 million clinical item values, 124 million
                  biological item values, and 3.7 million free text reports.
                  The ethics committee of the hospital evaluates all {CDW}
                  projects that generate secondary data marts.
                  Characteristics of the 74 research projects validated
                  between January 2011 and December 2015 are described.
                  Conclusion The use of {HEGP} {CDWs} is a key facilitator
                  for clinical research studies. It required however
                  important methodological and organizational support efforts

              Uncertainty-Aware Models},
  abstract = {Recommending the best course of action for an individual
              is a major application of individual-level causal effect
              estimation. This application is often needed in
              safety-critical domains such as healthcare, where
              estimating and communicating uncertainty to decision-makers
              is crucial. We introduce a practical approach for
              integrating uncertainty estimation into a class of
              state-of-the-art neural network methods used for
              individual-level causal estimates. We show that our methods
              enable us to deal gracefully with situations of
              "no-overlap", common in high-dimensional data, where
              standard applications of causal effect approaches fail.
              Further, our methods allow us to handle covariate shift,
              where test distribution differs to train distribution,
              common when systems are deployed in practice. We show that
              when such a covariate shift occurs, correctly modeling
              uncertainty can keep us from giving overconfident and
              potentially harmful recommendations. We demonstrate our
              methodology with a range of state-of-the-art models. Under
              both covariate shift and lack of overlap, our
              uncertainty-equipped methods can alert decisions makers
              when predictions are not to be trusted while outperforming
              their uncertainty-oblivious counterparts.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite a consensus that the use of health
              information technology should lead to more efficient,
              safer, and higher-quality care, there are no reliable
              estimates of the prevalence of adoption of electronic
              health records in U.S. hospitals. METHODS: We surveyed all
              acute care hospitals that are members of the American
              Hospital Association for the presence of specific
              electronic-record functionalities. Using a definition of
              electronic health records based on expert consensus, we
              determined the proportion of hospitals that had such
              systems in their clinical areas. We also examined the
              relationship of adoption of electronic health records to
              specific hospital characteristics and factors that were
              reported to be barriers to or facilitators of adoption.
              RESULTS: On the basis of responses from 63.1\% of hospitals
              surveyed, only 1.5\% of U.S. hospitals have a comprehensive
              electronic-records system (i.e., present in all clinical
              units), and an additional 7.6\% have a basic system (i.e.,
              present in at least one clinical unit). Computerized
              provider-order entry for medications has been implemented
              in only 17\% of hospitals. Larger hospitals, those located
              in urban areas, and teaching hospitals were more likely to
              have electronic-records systems. Respondents cited capital
              requirements and high maintenance costs as the primary
              barriers to implementation, although hospitals with
              electronic-records systems were less likely to cite these
              barriers than hospitals without such systems. CONCLUSIONS:
              The very low levels of adoption of electronic health
              records in U.S. hospitals suggest that policymakers face
              substantial obstacles to the achievement of health care
              performance goals that depend on health information
              technology. A policy strategy focused on financial support,
              interoperability, and training of technical support staff
              may be necessary to spur adoption of electronic-records
              systems in U.S. hospitals.},

  abstract = {The goal of this study is to examine the trends of
              Electronic Health Record (EHR) adoption among hospitals in
              Japan compared to those in the United States. Japan's
              nationwide survey of hospitals was utilized to extract the
              EHR adoption rates among Japanese hospitals. Comparable
              datasets from the Healthcare Information and Management
              System Society (HIMSS) and the American Hospital
              Association (AHA) were utilized to extract EHR adoption
              rates among U.S. hospitals. The trends of EHR adoption were
              stratified and analyzed by hospital size and hospital
              ownership status. As of 2014, the U.S. hospitals had a
              wider adoption of 'basic with clinical notes' EHRs compared
              to Japan (45.6\% vs. 27.3\%), but large hospitals (400+
              beds) in Japan have shown a similar adoption rate of EHR
              systems than those of U.S. (65.6\% vs. 68.5\%).
              Governmental hospitals tend to be more advanced in EHR
              adoption than non-profit hospitals in Japan (53.0\% vs.
              21.5\%). Non-profit hospitals show the highest adoption
              rate of 'basic' EHR systems in the U.S. as of 2014
              (63.3\%). Using the 'certified' definition of EHRs, the EHR
              adoption rate was close to 96\% among U.S. hospitals as of
              2016; however, updated EHR adoption data from Japanese
              hospitals has yet to be collected and published. U.S. and
              Japan have considerably increased EHR adoption among
              hospitals; however, this analysis indicates different
              trends of EHR adoption among hospitals by size and
              ownership status in both countries. Learnings from
              government programs supporting EHR adoption in the U.S. and
              Japan can be helpful in planning useful strategies for
              future hospital-oriented health IT policies in other
              developed nations.},

  abstract   = {OBJECTIVE: The adoption rate of electronic health record
                (EHR) systems in South Korea has continuously increased.
                However, in contrast to the situation in the United States
                (US), where there has been a national effort to improve and
                standardize EHR interoperability, no consensus has been
                established in South Korea. The goal of this study was to
                determine the current status of EHR adoption in South
                Korean hospitals compared to that in the US. METHODS: All
                general and tertiary teaching hospitals in South Korea were
                surveyed regarding their EHR status in 2015 with the same
                questionnaire as used previously. The survey form estimated
                the level of adoption of EHR systems according to 24 core
                functions in four categories (clinical documentation,
                result view, computerized provider order entry, and
                decision supports). The adoption level was classified into
                comprehensive and basic EHR systems according to their
                functionalities. RESULTS: EHRs and computerized physician
                order entry systems were used in 58.1\% and 86.0\% of South
                Korean hospitals, respectively. Decision support systems
                and problem list documentation were the functions most
                frequently missing from comprehensive and basic EHR
                systems. The main barriers cited to adoption of EHR systems
                were the cost of purchasing (48\%) and the ongoing cost of
                maintenance (11\%). DISCUSSION: The EHR adoption rate in
                Korean hospitals (37.2\%) was higher than that in US
                hospitals in 2010 (15.1\%), but this trend was reversed in
                2015 (58.1\% vs. 75.2\%). The evidence suggests that these
                trends were influenced by the level of financial and
                political support provided to US hospitals after the HITECH
                Act was passed in 2009. CONCLUSIONS: The EHR adoption rate
                in Korea has increased, albeit more slowly than in the US.
                It is logical to suggest that increased funding and support
                tied to the HITECH Act in the US partly explains the
                difference in the adoption rates of EHRs in both countries.},

  volume   = {23},
  abstract = {Coincident with the tsunami of {COVID}-19–related
              publications, there has been a surge of studies using
              real-world data, including those obtained from the
              electronic health record ({EHR}). Unfortunately, several of
              these high-profile publications were retracted because of
              concerns regarding the soundness and quality of the studies
              and the {EHR} data they purported to analyze. These
              retractions highlight that although a small community of
              {EHR} informatics experts can readily identify strengths
              and flaws in {EHR}-derived studies, many medical editorial
              teams and otherwise sophisticated medical readers lack the
              framework to fully critically appraise these studies. In
              addition, conventional statistical analyses cannot overcome
              the need for an understanding of the opportunities and
              limitations of {EHR}-derived studies. We distill here from
              the broader informatics literature six key considerations
              that are crucial for appraising studies utilizing {EHR}
              data: data completeness, data collection and handling (eg,
              transformation), data type (ie, codified, textual),
              robustness of methods against {EHR} variability (within and
              across institutions, countries, and time), transparency of
              data and analytic code, and the multidisciplinary approach.
              These considerations will inform researchers, clinicians,
              and other stakeholders as to the recommended best practices
              in reviewing manuscripts, grants, and other outputs from
              {EHR}-data derived studies, and thereby promote and foster
              rigor, quality, and reliability of this rapidly growing
              field.},

  abstract     = {There is growing interest in estimating and analyzing
                  heterogeneous treatment effects in experimental and
                  observational studies. We describe a number of
                  metaalgorithms that can take advantage of any supervised
                  learning or regression method in machine learning and
                  statistics to estimate the conditional average treatment
                  effect ({CATE}) function. Metaalgorithms build on base
                  algorithms—such as random forests ({RFs}), Bayesian
                  additive regression trees ({BARTs}), or neural
                  networks—to estimate the {CATE}, a function that the base
                  algorithms are not designed to estimate directly. We
                  introduce a metaalgorithm, the X-learner, that is provably
                  efficient when the number of units in one treatment group
                  is much larger than in the other and can exploit structural
                  properties of the {CATE} function. For example, if the
                  {CATE} function is linear and the response functions in
                  treatment and control are Lipschitz-continuous, the
                  X-learner can still achieve the parametric rate under
                  regularity conditions. We then introduce versions of the
                  X-learner that use {RF} and {BART} as base learners. In
                  extensive simulation studies, the X-learner performs
                  favorably, although none of the metalearners is uniformly
                  the best. In two persuasion field experiments from
                  political science, we demonstrate how our X-learner can be
                  used to target treatment regimes and to shed light on
                  underlying mechanisms. A software package is provided that
                  implements our methods.},

  abstract     = {When trying to learn a model for the prediction of an
                  outcome given a set of covariates, a statistician has many
                  estimation procedures in their toolbox. A few examples of
                  these candidate learners are: least squares, least angle
                  regression, random forests, and spline regression. Previous
                  articles (van der Laan and Dudoit (2003); van der Laan et
                  al. (2006); Sinisi et al. (2007)) theoretically validated
                  the use of cross validation to select an optimal learner
                  among many candidate learners. Motivated by this use of
                  cross validation, we propose a new prediction method for
                  creating a weighted combination of many candidate learners
                  to build the super learner. This article proposes a fast
                  algorithm for constructing a super learner in prediction
                  which uses V-fold cross-validation to select weights to
                  combine an initial set of candidate learners. In addition,
                  this paper contains a practical demonstration of the
                  adaptivity of this so called super learner to various true
                  data generating distributions. This approach for
                  construction of a super learner generalizes to any
                  parameter which can be defined as a minimizer of a loss
                  function.},

                ten-year project and provide guidance for the
                implementation of such a project. Our clinical data
                warehouse is mainly fed with data collected by the
                anesthesia information management system and hospital
                discharge reports. The data warehouse stores historical and

                administrative data, and of the second for monitoring data.
                Datamarts complete the architecture and provide secondary

  volume       = {7},
  shorttitle   = {Building a Semantic Health Data Warehouse in the Context
                  of Clinical Trials},
  abstract     = {Background The huge amount of clinical, administrative,
                  and demographic data recorded and maintained by hospitals
                  can be consistently aggregated into health data warehouses
                  with a uniform data model. In 2017, Rouen University
                  Hospital ({RUH}) initiated the design of a semantic health
                  data warehouse enabling both semantic description and
                  retrieval of health information.
                  
                  Objective This study aimed to present a proof of concept of
                  this semantic health data warehouse, based on the data of
                  250,000 patients from {RUH}, and to assess its ability to
                  assist health professionals in prescreening eligible
                  patients in a clinical trials context.
                  
                  Methods The semantic health data warehouse relies on 3
                  distinct semantic layers: (1) a terminology and ontology
                  portal, (2) a semantic annotator, and (3) a semantic search
                  engine and {NoSQL} (not only structured query language)
                  layer to enhance data access performances. The system
                  adopts an entity-centered vision that provides generic
                  search capabilities able to express data requirements in
                  terms of the whole set of interconnected conceptual
                  entities that compose health information.
                  
                  Results We assessed the ability of the system to assist the
                  search for 95 inclusion and exclusion criteria originating
                  from 5 randomly chosen clinical trials from {RUH}. The
                  system succeeded in fully automating 39\% (29/74) of the
                  criteria and was efficiently used as a prescreening tool
                  for 73\% (54/74) of them. Furthermore, the targeted sources
                  of information and the search engine–related or
                  data-related limitations that could explain the results for
                  each criterion were also observed.
                  
                  Conclusions The entity-centered vision contrasts with the
                  usual patient-centered vision adopted by existing systems.
                  It enables more genericity in the information retrieval
                  process. It also allows to fully exploit the semantic
                  description of health information. Despite their semantic
                  annotation, searching within clinical narratives remained
                  the major challenge of the system. A finer annotation of
                  the clinical texts and the addition of specific
                  functionalities would significantly improve the results.
                  The semantic aspect of the system combined with its generic
                  entity-centered vision enables the processing of a large
                  range of clinical questions. However, an important part of
                  health information remains in clinical narratives, and we
                  are currently investigating novel approaches (deep
                  learning) to enhance the semantic annotation of those
                  unstructured data.},

                health information technology. Results: From 2007 to 2018,
                the average adoption rates of the sampled hospitals in
                China increased from 18.6\% to 85.3\%, compared to the
                increase from 9.4\% to 96\% in US hospitals from 2008 to
                2017. The annual average adoption rates in Chinese and US
                hospitals were 6.1\% and 9.6\%, respectively. However, the
                annual average number of hospitals adopting EHRs was 1500
                in China and 534 in the US, indicating that the former
                might require more effort. Both countries faced similar
                major challenges for hospital digitalization. Conclusions:
                The adoption rates of hospital EHRs in China and the United
                States have both increased significantly in the past 10
                years. The number of hospitals that adopted EHRs in China
                exceeded 16,000, which was 3.3 times that of the 4814
                nonfederal US hospitals. This faster adoption outcome may
                have been a benefit of top-level design and government-led
                policies, particularly the inclusion of EHR adoption as an
                important indicator for performance evaluation and the
                appointment of public hospitals.},

              medication for a speciﬁc patient, is a problem of growing
              importance for policy makers. The most important aspect of
              inferring causal effects from observational data is the
              handling of confounders, factors that affect both an
              intervention and its outcome. A carefully designed
              observational study attempts to measure all important
              confounders. However, even if one does not have direct
              access to all confounders, there may exist noisy and
              uncertain measurement of proxies for confounders. We build
              on recent advances in latent variable modeling to
              simultaneously estimate the unknown latent space

              statistics from the linked birth/infant death data set
              (linked file)-1995 period data by a variety of maternal and
              infant characteristics. Trends in birthweight-specific
              infant mortality rates from 1985-95 are also discussed.
              METHODS: Descriptive tabulations of data from the linked
              RESULTS: In general, mortality rates were lowest for
              infants born to Asian and Pacific Islander mothers,
              followed by white, American Indian, and black mothers.
              Rates for infants of Hispanic origin mothers were slightly
              lower than or comparable to those for infants of white
              mothers, except for infants of Puerto Rican mothers who had
              higher infant mortality rates. Infant mortality rates were
              higher for those infants whose mothers began prenatal care
              after the first trimester of pregnancy, were teenagers or
              40 years of age or older, did not complete high school,
              were unmarried, or smoked during pregnancy. Infant
              mortality was also higher for male infants, multiple
              births, and infants born preterm or at low birthweight. In
              1995, 63 percent of all infant deaths occurred to the 7.3
              percent of infants born at low birthweight. From 1985-95,
              birthweight-specific infant mortality rates declined most
              rapidly for infants weighing 750-1,499 grams at birth. The
              leading causes of infant death varied considerably by race
              and Hispanic origin. For infants of black mothers,
              Disorders related to short gestation and unspecified low
              birthweight was the leading cause of infant death, with an
              infant mortality rate 4.5 times higher than that for
              infants of white mothers. For infants of American Indian
              mothers, rates for Sudden infant death syndrome were 2.9
              times and for Accidents and adverse effects 3.6 times
              higher than those for infants of white mothers. For infants
              of Hispanic mothers, mortality rates from Sudden infant
              death syndrome were one-third lower than those for infants

                  d’indicateurs d’aide à la décision est essentielle au
                  pilotage d’un établissement. Elle nécessite
                  l’interrogation de données issues de sources multiples
                  et sur plusieurs années. Pour répondre à cet objectif,
                  le {DIM} du {CHU} de Montpellier a créé un entrepôt de
                  données (entrepôt) indépendant du {SIH} de production.
                  Cet entrepôt assure la centralisation et l’historisation
                  des données issues des différents champs et domaines
                  d’activité de l’hôpital. Méthodes L’entrepôt est
                  une base de données relationnelle. Les données sont
                  consolidées depuis 1996. Concernant l’exercice en cours,
                  un ensemble de programme alimente quotidiennement
                  l’entrepôt. Lors de cette phase, des contrôles
                  permettent de vérifier l’intégrité des données et
                  d’améliorer la qualité des informations collectées.
                  Résultats À ce jour, l’entrepôt regroupe 323 tables
                  concernant 13,5 millions de séjours et 2,2 millions de
                  patients. Les informations sont issues notamment des
                  domaines suivants : {PMSI}, mouvements, actes,
                  médicaments, dispositifs médicaux implantables,
                  facturation, comptes rendus médicaux. Les dossiers de
                  spécialités représentent le plus gros volume de données
                  avec 22,3 millions de questionnaires et 186,4 millions de
                  réponses. L’analyse croisée de ces données issues de
                  sources multiples a permis de créer de nouveaux
                  indicateurs (indicateurs d’exploitation des blocs
                  chirurgicaux…) ou de faciliter le recueil d’indicateurs
                  ({IPAQSS} « Traçabilité de l’évaluation de la
                  douleur »…). L’exploitation de données hors du champ
                  {PMSI} (biologie, {IMC}, transmissions infirmières…)
                  contribue à l’optimisation des recettes T2A.
                  Discussion/Conclusion Cet entrepôt est évolutif et
                  garantit la pérennité des données. Il a permis au {DIM}
                  d’améliorer le traitement des informations et de mettre
                  à disposition des services (Direction, Recherche clinique,
                  services médicaux…) des indicateurs de pilotage

                reviews have identified only a few applications used in
                clinical practice. In this study, we aim to (1) identify
                and characterize AI applications used in the clinical
                response to COVID-19; (2) examine the timing, location, and
                extent of their use; (3) examine how they relate to
                pre-pandemic applications and the U.S. regulatory approval
                process; and (4) characterize the evidence that is
                available to support their use. We searched academic and
                grey literature sources to identify 66 AI applications that
                performed a wide range of diagnostic, prognostic, and
                triage functions in the clinical response to COVID-19. Many
                were deployed early in the pandemic and most were used in
                the U.S., other high-income countries, or China. While some
                applications were used to care for hundreds of thousands of
                patients, others were used to an unknown or limited extent.
                We found studies supporting the use of 39 applications,
                though few of these were independent evaluations and we
                found no clinical trials evaluating any
                applicationâ€™s impact on patient health. Due to
                limited evidence, it is impossible to determine the extent
                to which the clinical use of AI in the pandemic response
                has benefited patients overall. Further research is needed,
                particularly independent evaluations on AI application
                performance and health impacts in real-world care
                settings.},

  abstract     = {With the widespread use of artificial intelligence ({AI})
                  systems and applications in our everyday lives, accounting
                  for fairness has gained significant importance in designing
                  and engineering of such systems. {AI} systems can be used
                  in many sensitive environments to make important and
                  life-changing decisions; thus, it is crucial to ensure that
                  these decisions do not reflect discriminatory behavior
                  toward certain groups or populations. More recently some
                  work has been developed in traditional machine learning and
                  deep learning that address such challenges in different
                  subdomains. With the commercialization of these systems,
                  researchers are becoming more aware of the biases that
                  these applications can contain and are attempting to
                  address them. In this survey, we investigated different
                  real-world applications that have shown biases in various
                  ways, and we listed different sources of biases that can
                  affect {AI} applications. We then created a taxonomy for
                  fairness definitions that machine learning researchers have
                  defined to avoid the existing bias in {AI} systems. In
                  addition to that, we examined different domains and
                  subdomains in {AI} showing what researchers have observed
                  with regard to unfair outcomes in the state-of-the-art
                  methods and ways they have tried to address them. There are
                  still many future directions and solutions that can be
                  taken to mitigate the problem of bias in {AI} systems. We
                  are hoping that this survey will motivate researchers to
                  tackle these issues in the near future by observing
                  existing work in their respective fields.},

              neural networks. Many instances of miscalibration in modern
              neural networks have been reported, suggesting a trend that

              predictions. Here, we revisit this question for recent
              state-of-the-art image classification models. We
              systematically relate model calibration and accuracy, and
              find that the most recent models, notably those not using
              convolutions, are among the best calibrated. Trends
              observed in prior model generations, such as decay of
              calibration with distribution shift or model size, are less
              pronounced in recent architectures. We also show that model

  title     = {Model Cards for Model Reporting},
  abstract  = {Trained machine learning models are increasingly used to
               perform high-impact tasks in areas such as law enforcement,
               medicine, education, and employment. In order to clarify
               the intended use cases of machine learning models and
               minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not
               well suited, we recommend that released models be
               accompanied by documentation detailing their performance
               characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that
               we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model
               reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying
               trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked
               evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across
               different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups
               (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin
               type) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex
               and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the
               intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the
               context in which models are intended to be used, details of
               the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant
               information. While we focus primarily on human-centered
               machine learning models in the application fields of
               computer vision and natural language processing, this
               framework can be used to document any trained machine
               learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards
               for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling
               faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments
               in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the
               responsible democratization of machine learning and related
               {AI} technology, increasing transparency into how well {AI}
               technology works. We hope this work encourages those
               releasing trained machine learning models to accompany
               model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and
               other relevant documentation.},

  abstract = {This study seeks to better understand the impact that
              government technology procurement regulations have on
              social value and national competitiveness. To do this, it
              examines the impact of a change in France’s technology
              procurement policy that required government agencies to
              favor open source software ({OSS}) over proprietary
              software in an attempt to reduce costs creating an
              unexpected demand shock for {OSS}. Analysis using the rest
              of the {EU} as controls via difference-in-differences and
              synthetic control frameworks shows that this policy change
              led to an increase of nearly 600,000 {OSS} contributions
              per year from France, creating social value by increasing
              the availability and quality of free and open source
              software. Estimates indicate this would have cost paid
              software developers roughly \$20 million per year to
              replicate. However, the open nature of such goods means
              that any country can reap the benefits of these efforts.
              Therefore, additional economic outcomes that enhance
              France’s competitiveness are also considered. The results
              show that within France, the regulation led to a 0.6\% -
              5.4\% yearly increase in companies that use {OSS}, a 9\% -
              18\% yearly increase in the number of {IT}-related
              startups, a 6.6\% - 14\% yearly increase in the number of
              individuals employed in {IT} related jobs, and a 5\% - 16\%
              yearly decrease in software related patents. All of these
              outcomes help to increase productivity and competitiveness
              at the national level. In aggregate, these results show
              that changes in government technology policy that favor
              {OSS} can have a positive impact on both global social
              value and domestic national competitiveness.},

               boosted trees and boosted stumps push probability mass away
               from 0 and 1 yielding a characteristic sigmoid shaped
               distortion in the predicted probabilities. Models such as
               Naive Bayes, which make unrealistic independence
               assumptions, push probabilities toward 0 and 1. Other
               models such as neural nets and bagged trees do not have
               these biases and predict well calibrated probabilities. We
               experiment with two ways of correcting the biased
               probabilities predicted by some learning methods: Platt
               Scaling and Isotonic Regression. We qualitatively examine
               what kinds of distortions these calibration methods are
               suitable for and quantitatively examine how much data they
               need to be effective. The empirical results show that after
               calibration boosted trees, random forests, and SVMs predict
               the best probabilities.},

  title    = {Quasi-Oracle Estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment
              Effects},
  abstract = {Flexible estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects
              lies at the heart of many statistical challenges, such as
              personalized medicine and optimal resource allocation. In
              this paper, we develop a general class of two-step
              algorithms for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in
              observational studies. We first estimate marginal effects
              and treatment propensities in order to form an objective
              function that isolates the causal component of the signal.
              Then, we optimize this data-adaptive objective function.
              Our approach has several advantages over existing methods.
              From a practical perspective, our method is flexible and
              easy to use: In both steps, we can use any
              loss-minimization method, e.g., penalized regression, deep
              neural networks, or boosting; moreover, these methods can
              be fine-tuned by cross validation. Meanwhile, in the case
              of penalized kernel regression, we show that our method has
              a quasi-oracle property: Even if the pilot estimates for
              marginal effects and treatment propensities are not
              particularly accurate, we achieve the same error bounds as
              an oracle who has a priori knowledge of these two nuisance
              components. We implement variants of our approach based on
              penalized regression, kernel ridge regression, and boosting
              in a variety of simulation setups, and find promising
              performance relative to existing baselines.},

                données cliniques ({EDC}), pour faciliter le
                pré-screening. Méthodes L’automatisation du
                pré-screening pose trois difficultés : l’extraction
                des critères d’éligibilité ({CE}), l’extraction
                d’entités cliniques depuis les comptes rendus ({CR})
                textuels, l’export des données vers un standard de
                réutilisation. Nous avons abordé ces problèmes au
                travers d’études cliniques d’onco-pneumologie du
                registre d’{OncoBretagne} et de l’{EDC} du {CHU} de
                Rennes. Les {CE} en texte libre ont été convertis en
                requêtes, les variables impliquées ont été décrites.
                Lorsque ces variables n’étaient pas structurées au sein
                d’{eHOP}, elles étaient extraites des {CR} à l’aide
                d’algorithmes de Traitement automatique du langage
                ({TAL}) qui ont été évalués par rapport à une
                extraction manuelle. Les données étaient exportées dans
                un format standardisé. Résultats La conversion des {CE}
                en requêtes révèle certaines limitations : certains ne
                pouvaient être évalués (ex : compliance), devaient
                être réévalués à l’inclusion (ex : biologie
                standard), étaient trop ambigus ou trop spécifiques. Au
                total, 361 {CE} au sein de 49 études ont été convertis
                en 464 requêtes, impliquant 23 variables distinctes. Dix
                variables n’étaient pas pertinentes pour le
                pré-screening, 4 étaient déjà structurées dans
                l’{EDC}. Le {TAL} a permis l’extraction des codes
                morphologiques {CIM}-O (rappe : 97,8 \%, précision :
                100 \%), du score {OMS} (rappel : 100 \%, précision :
                100 \%), du {TNM} (rappel : 98,0 \%, précision :
                97,6 \%) et du stade (rappel : 99,7 \%, précision :
                97,5 \%). Les données étaient exportées aux formats
                {OSIRIS} et {OMOP} common-data-model. Discussion/Conclusion
                La conversion des {CE} en requêtes demeure complexe. En
                attendant l’adoption d’un standard structuré, leur
                conversion manuelle semble inévitable. Les principales
                variables d’éligibilité ont été extraites d’{eHOP}
                vers un standard de réutilisation, sur lequel les
                requêtes sont exécutées. Nous avons décrit un pipeline
                complet, de l’intégration des données dans l’{EDC} à

  volume       = {20},
  abstract     = {{BACKGROUND}: The promises of improved health care and
                  health research through data-intensive applications rely on
                  a growing amount of health data. At the core of large-scale
                  data integration efforts, clinical data warehouses ({CDW})
                  are also responsible for data governance, managing data
                  access and (re)use. As the complexity of the data flow
                  increases, greater transparency and standardization of
                  criteria and procedures are required in order to maintain
                  objective oversight and control. Therefore, the development
                  of practice oriented and evidence-based policies is
                  crucial. This study assessed the spectrum of data access
                  and use criteria and procedures in clinical data warehouses
                  governance internationally. {METHODS}: We performed a
                  systematic review of (a) the published scientific
                  literature on {CDW} and (b) publicly available information
                  on {CDW} data access, e.g., data access policies. A
                  qualitative thematic analysis was applied to all included
                  literature and policies. {RESULTS}: Twenty-three scientific
                  publications and one policy document were included in the
                  final analysis. The qualitative analysis led to a final set
                  of three main thematic categories: (1) requirements,
                  including recipient requirements, reuse requirements, and
                  formal requirements; (2) structures and processes,
                  including review bodies and review values; and (3) access,
                  including access limitations. {CONCLUSIONS}: The
                  description of data access and use governance in the
                  scientific literature is characterized by a high level of
                  heterogeneity and ambiguity. In practice, this might limit
                  the effective data sharing needed to fulfil the high
                  expectations of data-intensive approaches in medical
                  research and health care. The lack of publicly available
                  information on access policies conflicts with ethical
                  requirements linked to principles of transparency and
                  accountability. {CDW} should publicly disclose by whom and
                  under which conditions data can be accessed, and provide
                  designated governance structures and policies to increase

              often have little quantitative evidence on which to base
              their decisions, beyond their medical education and
              published clinical trials. Stanford Health Care alone has
              millions of electronic medical records that are only just
              recently being leveraged to inform better treatment
              recommendations. These data present a unique challenge
              because they are high dimensional and observational. Our
              goal is to make personalized treatment recommendations
              based on the outcomes for past patients similar to a new
              patient. We propose and analyze 3 methods for estimating
              heterogeneous treatment effects using observational data.
              Our methods perform well in simulations using a wide
              variety of treatment effect functions, and we present
              results of applying the 2 most promising methods to data

                capacity for conducting cost-effective clinical trials and
                allow research to be embedded within routine care delivery.
                While pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs) have been performed
                for decades, they now can draw on rich sources of clinical
                and operational data that are continuously fed back to
                inform research and practice. The Health Care Systems
                Collaboratory program, initiated by the NIH Common Fund in
                2012, engages healthcare systems as partners in discussing
                and promoting activities, tools, and strategies for
                supporting active participation in PCTs. The NIH
                Collaboratory consists of seven demonstration projects, and
                seven problem-specific working group ‘Cores’, aimed at
                leveraging the data captured in heterogeneous
                ‘real-world’ environments for research, thereby
                improving the efficiency, relevance, and generalizability
                of trials. Here, we introduce the Collaboratory, focusing
                on its Phenotype, Data Standards, and Data Quality Core,
                and present early observations from researchers
                implementing PCTs within large healthcare systems. We also
                identify gaps in knowledge and present an informatics
                research agenda that includes identifying methods for the
                definition and appropriate application of phenotypes in
                diverse healthcare settings, and methods for validating
                both the definition and execution of electronic health

  volume       = {7},
  abstract     = {In observational cohort mortality studies with prolonged
                  periods of exposure to the agent under study, it is not
                  uncommon for risk factors for death to be determinants of
                  subsequent exposure. For instance, in occupational
                  mortality studies date of termination of employment is both
                  a determinant of future exposure (since terminated
                  individuals receive no further exposure) and an independent
                  risk factor for death (since disabled individuals tend to
                  leave employment). When current risk factor status
                  determines subsequent exposure and is determined by
                  previous exposure, standard analyses that estimate
                  age-specific mortality rates as a function of cumulative
                  exposure may underestimate the true effect of exposure on
                  mortality whether or not one adjusts for the risk factor in
                  the analysis. This observation raises the question, which
                  if any population parameters can be given a causal
                  interpretation in observational mortality studies? In
                  answer, we offer a graphical approach to the identification
                  and computation of causal parameters in mortality studies
                  with sustained exposure periods. This approach is shown to
                  be equivalent to an approach in which the observational
                  study is identified with a hypothetical double-blind
                  randomized trial in which data on each subject's assigned
                  treatment protocol has been erased from the data file.
                  Causal inferences can then be made by comparing mortality
                  as a function of treatment protocol, since, in a
                  double-blind randomized trial missing data on treatment
                  protocol, the association of mortality with treatment
                  protocol can still be estimated. We reanalyze the mortality
                  experience of a cohort of arsenic-exposed copper smelter
                  workers with our method and compare our results with those
                  obtained using standard methods. We find an adverse effect
                  of arsenic exposure on all-cause and lung cancer mortality
                  which standard methods fail to detect.},

              independent of it. Estimators of β based on incorrect

              consistent nonparametric estimators deviate from β by a
              larger probability order than N$^{\textrm{-1/2}}$, where N
              is sample size. An estimator generalizing the ordinary
              least squares estimator of β is constructed by inserting

                  response may be heteroge neous with respect to certain
                  baseline covariates. This is an important premise of
                  personalized medicine. Several methods for estimating
                  heterogeneous treatment effects have been proposed.
                  However, little attention has been given to the problem of
                  choosing between estimators of treat ment effects. Models
                  that best estimate the regression function may not be best
                  for estimating the effect of a treatment; therefore, there
                  is a need for model selection methods that are targeted to
                  treatment effect estimation. We demonstrate an application
                  of the focused information crite rion in this setting and
                  develop a treatment effect cross-validation aimed at
                  minimizing treatment effect estimation errors.
                  Theoretically, treatment effect cross-validation has a
                  model selection consistency property when the data
                  splitting ratio is properly chosen. Practically, treatment
                  effect cross-validation has the flexibility to compare
                  different types of models. We illustrate the meth ods by
                  using simulation studies and data from a clinical trial
                  comparing treatments of patients with human
                  immunodeficiency virus.},

  volume       = {100},
  abstract     = {Causal effects are defined as comparisons of potential
                  outcomes under different treatments on a common set of
                  units. Observed values of the potential outcomes are
                  revealed by the assignment mechanism—a probabilistic
                  model for the treatment each unit receives as a function of
                  covariates and potential outcomes. Fisher made tremendous
                  contributions to causal inference through his work on the
                  design of randomized experiments, but the potential
                  outcomes perspective applies to other complex experiments
                  and nonrandomized studies as well. As noted by Kempthorne
                  in his 1976 discussion of Savage's Fisher lecture, Fisher
                  never bridged his work on experimental design and his work
                  on parametric modeling, a bridge that appears nearly
                  automatic with an appropriate view of the potential
                  outcomes framework, where the potential outcomes and
                  covariates are given a Bayesian distribution to complete
                  the model specification. Also, this framework crisply
                  separates scientific inference for causal effects and
                  decisions based on such inference, a distinction evident in
                  Fisher's discussion of tests of significance versus tests
                  in an accept/reject framework. But Fisher never used the
                  potential outcomes framework, originally proposed by Neyman
                  in the context of randomized experiments, and as a result
                  he provided generally flawed advice concerning the use of
                  the analysis of covariance to adjust for posttreatment
                  concomitants in randomized trials.},

                  expand knowledge about disease and appropriate treatments,
                  strengthen understanding about effectiveness and efficiency
                  of health care systems, support public health and security
                  goals, and aid businesses in meeting customers’ needs.
                  Yet, complex ethical, political, technical, and social
                  issues surround the secondary use of health data. While not
                  new, these issues play increasingly critical and complex
                  roles given current public and private sector activities
                  not only expanding health data volume, but also improving
                  access to data. Lack of coherent policies and standard
                  “good practices” for secondary use of health data
                  impedes efforts to strengthen the U.S. health care system.
                  The nation requires a framework for the secondary use of
                  health data with a robust infrastructure of policies,
                  standards, and best practices. Such a framework can guide
                  and facilitate widespread collection, storage, aggregation,
                  linkage, and transmission of health data. The framework
                  will provide appropriate protections for legitimate
                  secondary use.},

              what is likely to happen when they take an action. For
              instance, if I choose not to treat this patient, are they
              likely to die? Practitioners commonly use supervised
              learning algorithms to ﬁt predictive models that help
              decision-makers reason about likely future outcomes, but we
              show that this approach is unreliable, and sometimes even
              dangerous. The key issue is that supervised learning
              algorithms are highly sensitive to the policy used to
              choose actions in the training data, which causes the model
              to capture relationships that do not generalize. We propose
              using a different learning objective that predicts
              counterfactuals instead of predicting outcomes under an
              existing action policy as in supervised learning. To
              support decision-making in temporal settings, we introduce
              the Counterfactual Gaussian Process ({CGP}) to predict the
              counterfactual future progression of continuous-time
              trajectories under sequences of future actions. We
              demonstrate the beneﬁts of the {CGP} on two important

              and other ﬁelds are increasingly aware that decisions
              should be personalized to each patient, customer, or voter.
              A given treatment (e.g. a drug or advertisement) should be
              administered only to those who will respond most
              positively, and certainly not to those who will be harmed
              by it. Individual-level treatment eﬀects can be estimated
              with tools adapted from machine learning, but diﬀerent
              models can yield contradictory estimates. Unlike risk
              prediction models, however, treatment eﬀect models cannot
              be easily evaluated against each other using a held-out
              test set because the true treatment eﬀect itself is never
              directly observed. Besides outcome prediction accuracy,
              several metrics that can leverage held-out data to evaluate
              treatment eﬀects models have been proposed, but they are
              not widely used. We provide a didactic framework that
              elucidates the relationships between the diﬀerent
              approaches and compare them all using a variety of
              simulations of both randomized and observational data. Our
              results show that researchers estimating heterogenous
              treatment eﬀects need not limit themselves to a single
              model-ﬁtting algorithm. Instead of relying on a single
              method, multiple models ﬁt by a diverse set of algorithms
              should be evaluated against each other using an objective
              function learned from the validation set. The model
              minimizing that objective should be used for estimating the

  abstract     = {Estimation of causal effects using observational data
                  continues to grow in popularity in the epidemiologic
                  literature. While many applications of causal effect
                  estimation use propensity score methods or G-computation,
                  targeted maximum likelihood estimation ({TMLE}) is a
                  well-established alternative method with desirable
                  statistical properties. {TMLE} is a doubly robust
                  maximum-likelihood–based approach that includes a
                  secondary “targeting” step that optimizes the
                  bias-variance tradeoff for the target parameter. Under
                  standard causal assumptions, estimates can be interpreted
                  as causal effects. Because {TMLE} has not been as widely
                  implemented in epidemiologic research, we aim to provide an
                  accessible presentation of {TMLE} for applied researchers.
                  We give step-by-step instructions for using {TMLE} to
                  estimate the average treatment effect in the context of an
                  observational study. We discuss conceptual similarities and
                  differences between {TMLE} and 2 common estimation
                  approaches (G-computation and inverse probability
                  weighting) and present findings on their relative
                  performance using simulated data. Our simulation study
                  compares methods under parametric regression
                  misspecification; our results highlight {TMLE}'s property
                  of double robustness. Additionally, we discuss best
                  practices for {TMLE} implementation, particularly the use
                  of ensembled machine learning algorithms. Our simulation
                  study demonstrates all methods using super learning,
                  highlighting that incorporation of machine learning may
                  outperform parametric regression in observational data

  abstract   = {The availability of large, deidentified health datasets
                has enabled significant innovation in using machine
                learning (ML) to better understand patients and their
                diseases. However, questions remain regarding the true
                privacy of this data, patient control over their data, and
                how we regulate data sharing in a way that that does not
                encumber progress or further potentiate biases for
                underrepresented populations. After reviewing the
                literature on potential reidentifications of patients in
                publicly available datasets, we argue that the
                cost—measured in terms of access to future medical
                innovations and clinical software—of slowing ML progress
                is too great to limit sharing data through large publicly
                available databases for concerns of imperfect data
                anonymization. This cost is especially great for developing
                countries where the barriers preventing inclusion in such
                databases will continue to rise, further excluding these
                populations and increasing existing biases that favor
                high-income countries. Preventing artificial
                intelligence’s progress towards precision medicine and
                sliding back to clinical practice dogma may pose a larger
                threat than concerns of potential patient reidentification
                within publicly available datasets. While the risk to
                patient privacy should be minimized, we believe this risk
                will never be zero, and society has to determine an
                acceptable risk threshold below which data sharing can
                occur—for the benefit of a global medical knowledge

                  evaluating data suitability to satisfy the research needs
                  of observational studies. {MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}:
                  Suitability considerations were derived from a systematic
                  literature review on researchers' common data needs in
                  observational studies and a scoping review on frequent
                  clinical database design considerations, and were
                  harmonized to construct a suitability conceptual framework
                  using a bottom-up approach. The relationships among the
                  suitability categories are explored from the perspective of
                  4 facets of data: intrinsic, contextual, representational,
                  and accessible. A web-based national survey of domain
                  experts was conducted to validate the framework. {RESULTS}:
                  Data suitability for observational studies hinges on the
                  following key categories: Explicitness of Policy and Data
                  Governance, Relevance, Availability of Descriptive Metadata
                  and Provenance Documentation, Usability, and Quality. We
                  describe 16 measures and 33 sub-measures. The survey
                  uncovered the relevance of all categories, with a 5-point
                  Likert importance score of 3.9 ± 1.0 for Explicitness
                  of Policy and Data Governance, 4.1 ± 1.0 for
                  Relevance, 3.9 ± 0.9 for Availability of Descriptive
                  Metadata and Provenance Documentation, 4.2 ± 1.0 for
                  Usability, and 4.0 ± 0.9 for Quality. {CONCLUSIONS}:
                  The suitability framework evaluates a clinical data
                  source's fitness for research use. Its construction
                  reflects both researchers' points of view and data
                  custodians' design features. The feedback from domain
                  experts rated Usability, Relevance, and Quality categories
                  as the most important considerations.},

  title    = {Benchmarking Framework for Performance-Evaluation of
              Causal Inference Analysis},
  abstract = {Causal inference analysis is the estimation of the effects
              of actions on outcomes. In the context of healthcare data
              this means estimating the outcome of counter-factual
              treatments (i.e. including treatments that were not
              observed) on a patient's outcome. Compared to classic
              machine learning methods, evaluation and validation of
              causal inference analysis is more challenging because
              ground truth data of counter-factual outcome can never be
              obtained in any real-world scenario. Here, we present a
              comprehensive framework for benchmarking algorithms that
              estimate causal effect. The framework includes unlabeled
              data for prediction, labeled data for validation, and code
              for automatic evaluation of algorithm predictions using
              both established and novel metrics. The data is based on
              real-world covariates, and the treatment assignments and
              outcomes are based on simulations, which provides the basis
              for validation. In this framework we address two questions:
              one of scaling, and the other of data-censoring. The
              framework is available as open source code at
              https://github.com/{IBM}-{HRL}-{MLHLS}/{IBM}-Causal-Inference-Benchmarking-Framework},

                focused on G-computation includes theoretical explanations
                of the method but very few simulations or examples of
                application. The small number of G-computation analyses in
                the epidemiology literature relative to other causal
                inference approaches may be partially due to a lack of
                didactic explanations of the method targeted toward an
                epidemiology audience. The authors provide a step-by-step
                demonstration of G-computation that is intended to
                familiarize the reader with this procedure. The authors
                simulate a data set and then demonstrate both G-computation
                and traditional regression to draw connections and
                illustrate contrasts between their implementation and
                interpretation relative to the truth of the simulation
                protocol. A marginal structural model is used for effect
                estimation in the G-computation example. The authors
                conclude by answering a series of questions to emphasize
                the key characteristics of causal inference techniques and
                the G-computation procedure in particular.},

                different disease-related knowledge bodies to construct a
                comprehensive, machine interpretable diseasomics
                knowledge-graph that includes the Disease Ontology, disease
                symptoms, SNOMED CT, DisGeNET, and PharmGKB data. The
                resulting disease-symptom network comprises knowledge from
                the Symptom Ontology, electronic health records (EHR),
                human symptom disease network, Disease Ontology, Wikipedia,
                PubMed, textbooks, and symptomology knowledge sources with
                84.56\% accuracy. We also integrated spatial and temporal
                comorbidity knowledge obtained from EHR for two population
                data sets from Spain and Sweden respectively. The knowledge
                graph is stored in a graph database as a digital twin of
                the disease knowledge. We use node2vec (node embedding) as
                digital triplet for link prediction in disease-symptom
                networks to identify missing associations. This diseasomics
                knowledge graph is expected to democratize the medical
                knowledge and empower non-specialist health workers to make
                evidence based informed decisions and help achieve the goal
                of universal health coverage (UHC). The machine
                interpretable knowledge graphs presented in this paper are
                associations between various entities and do not imply
                causation. Our differential diagnostic tool focusses on
                signs and symptoms and does not include a complete
                assessment of patientâ€™s lifestyle and health history
                which would typically be necessary to rule out conditions
                and to arrive at a final diagnosis. The predicted diseases
                are ordered according to the specific disease burden in
                South Asia. The knowledge graphs and the tools presented
                here can be used as a guide.},

  abstract   = {In 1999, French legislators asked health insurance funds
                to develop a système national d’information
                interrégimes de l’Assurance Maladie ({SNIIRAM})
                [national health insurance information system] in order to
                more precisely determine and evaluate health care
                utilization and health care expenditure of beneficiaries.
                These data, based on almost 66 million inhabitants in 2015,
                have already been the subject of numerous international
                publications on various topics: prevalence and incidence of
                diseases, patient care pathways, health status and health
                care utilization of specific populations, real-life use of
                drugs, assessment of adverse effects of drugs or other
                health care procedures, monitoring of national health
                insurance expenditure, etc. {SNIIRAM} comprises individual
                information on the sociodemographic and medical
                characteristics of beneficiaries and all hospital care and
                office medicine reimbursements, coded according to various
                systems. Access to data is controlled by permissions
                dependent on the type of data requested or used, their
                temporality and the researcher's status. In general, data
                can be analyzed by accredited agencies over a period
                covering the last three years plus the current year, and
                specific requests can be submitted to extract data over
                longer periods. A 1/97th random sample of {SNIIRAM}, the
                échantillon généraliste des bénéficiaires ({EGB}),
                representative of the national population of health
                insurance beneficiaries, was composed in 2005 to allow
                20-year follow-up with facilitated access for medical
                research. The {EGB} is an open cohort, which includes new
                beneficiaries and newborn infants. {SNIIRAM} has continued
                to grow and extend to become, in 2016, the cornerstone of
                the future système national des données de santé
                ({SNDS}) [national health data system], which will
                gradually integrate new information (causes of death,
                social and medical data and complementary health
                insurance). In parallel, the modalities of data access and
                protection systems have also evolved. This article
                describes the {SNIIRAM} data warehouse and its
                transformation into {SNDS}, the data collected, the tools
                developed in order to facilitate data analysis, the
                limitations encountered, and changing access permissions.
                Résumé En France, le législateur a souhaité en 1999 que
                les régimes d’Assurance Maladie développent un système
                national d’information interrégimes de l’Assurance
                Maladie ({SNIIRAM}) afin de mieux connaître et évaluer le
                recours aux soins et les dépenses de santé des assurés.
                Ces données sur près de 66 millions d’habitants en 2015
                ont déjà donné lieu à de nombreuses publications
                internationales s’intéressant à différentes
                thématiques : prévalence et incidence de pathologies,
                parcours de soins de patients, état de santé et recours
                aux soins de populations spécifiques, usage des
                médicaments en vie réelle, mesure d’effet indésirables
                de médicaments ou d’autres procédures de soins, suivi
                des dépenses de l’Assurance Maladie, etc. Le {SNIIRAM}
                contient des informations individuelles sur des
                caractéristiques sociodémographiques et médicales des
                assurés et l’ensemble des remboursements de soins
                hospitaliers et de médecine de ville, codés selon
                différents référentiels. L’accès aux données est
                soumis à des autorisations qui sont fonction de la nature
                des données demandées ou utilisées, de leur temporalité
                et du statut du demandeur. De façon générale, les
                données peuvent être analysées par les organismes
                habilités sur la période couvrant les trois dernières
                années plus l’année en cours, et des demandes
                spécifiques peuvent être réalisées pour extraire des
                données portant sur des historiques plus longs. Un
                échantillon généraliste de bénéficiaires ({EGB}) au
                1/97e, représentatif de la population protégée au niveau
                national, a été constitué en 2005 pour permettre un
                suivi sur 20 ans avec un accès facilité pour la recherche
                médicale. Il s’agit d’une cohorte ouverte, qui inclut
                les nouveaux affiliés et nouveau-nés. Le {SNIIRAM} a
                continué à évoluer mais aussi à s’étendre pour
                devenir, en 2016, le socle du futur système national des
                données de santé ({SNDS}) qui intègrera progressivement
                de nouvelles informations (causes de décès, données
                médicosociales et des assurances complémentaires santé).
                Conjointement, les modalités d’accès aux données et
                les systèmes de protection évoluent aussi. Cet article a
                pour but de décrire le {SNIIRAM} et l’évolution vers le
                {SNDS}, les données recueillies, les outils développés
                afin d’en faciliter l’analyse, les limites
                rencontrées, les autorisations d’accès et leurs
                évolutions.},

  abstract    = {L'apparition des dossiers patient informatisés et la collection croissante de données liées aux soins a permis l'émergence d'entrepôts de données pouvant être utilisés en recherche clinique pour identifier et retrouver les données liées à un groupe de patients. La plateforme i2b2 choisie ici est à la fois un entrepôt et un outil de requêtes, disponible sous licence open source. L'objectif était l'étude de la faisabilité du déploiement de la plateforme i2b2 au {CHRU} de Nancy, explorant la représentation et l'intégration des données du {SIH}, et les règles de gouvernance. Un package R (R2b2) a été développé spécifiquement, permettant de gérer l'entrepôt, manipuler et intégrer les données. Les sources de données existantes dans le {SIH} ont été étudiées pour leur intégration, et un modèle de représentation des données a été choisi (ou conçu lorsque cela était nécessaire) pour organiser les concepts. Un dispositif a été mis en place pour protéger l'accès aux données, en miroir de la responsabilité médicale au {CHRU} et respectant les règles de collection et d'accès aux données de soins, permettant un retour direct aux praticiens. Un prototype fonctionnel est fourni, intégrant les données de 118330 patients lors de 247580 hospitalisations depuis début 2016, totalisant plus de 18 millions d'observations. Le travail conduit autour de ce prototype a permis de dégager plusieurs axes de conduite pour la mise en production du projet, et les règles régissant les accès.},

  title    = {Estimation and Inference of Heterogeneous Treatment
              Effects using Random Forests},
  volume   = {113},
  abstract = {Many scientific and engineering challenges—ranging from
              personalized medicine to customized marketing
              recommendations—require an understanding of treatment
              effect heterogeneity. In this article, we develop a
              nonparametric causal forest for estimating heterogeneous
              treatment effects that extends Breiman’s widely used
              random forest algorithm. In the potential outcomes
              framework with unconfoundedness, we show that causal
              forests are pointwise consistent for the true treatment
              effect and have an asymptotically Gaussian and centered
              sampling distribution. We also discuss a practical method
              for constructing asymptotic confidence intervals for the
              true treatment effect that are centered at the causal
              forest estimates. Our theoretical results rely on a generic
              Gaussian theory for a large family of random forest
              algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first set of
              results that allows any type of random forest, including
              classification and regression forests, to be used for
              provably valid statistical inference. In experiments, we
              find causal forests to be substantially more powerful than
              classical methods based on nearest-neighbor matching,
              especially in the presence of irrelevant covariates.},

  title    = {Comparing methods for estimation of heterogeneous
              treatment effects using observational data from health care
              databases},
  abstract = {There is growing interest in using routinely collected
              data from health care databases to study the safety and
              effectiveness of therapies in “real-world” conditions,
              as it can provide complementary evidence to that of
              randomized controlled trials. Causal inference from health
              care databases is challenging because the data are
              typically noisy, high dimensional, and most importantly,
              observational. It requires methods that can estimate
              heterogeneous treatment effects while controlling for
              confounding in high dimensions. Bayesian additive
              regression trees, causal forests, causal boosting, and
              causal multivariate adaptive regression splines are
              off-the-shelf methods that have shown good performance for
              estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects in
              observational studies of continuous outcomes. However, it
              is not clear how these methods would perform in health care
              database studies where outcomes are often binary and rare
              and data structures are complex. In this study, we evaluate
              these methods in simulation studies that recapitulate key
              characteristics of comparative effectiveness studies. We
              focus on the conditional average effect of a binary
              treatment on a binary outcome using the conditional risk
              difference as an estimand. To emulate health care database
              studies, we propose a simulation design where real
              covariate and treatment assignment data are used and only
              outcomes are simulated based on nonparametric models of the
              real outcomes. We apply this design to 4 published
              observational studies that used records from 2 major health
              care databases in the United States. Our results suggest
              that Bayesian additive regression trees and causal boosting
              consistently provide low bias in conditional risk
              difference estimates in the context of health care database
              studies.},

  abstract = {Accurate, well-calibrated estimates of class membership
              probabilities are needed in many supervised learning
              applications, in particular when a cost-sensitive decision
              must be made about examples with example-dependent costs.
              This paper presents simple but successful methods for
              obtaining calibrated probability estimates from decision
              tree and naive Bayesian classiﬁers. Using the large and
              challenging KDD’98 contest dataset as a testbed, we
              report the results of a detailed experimental comparison of
              ten methods, according to four evaluation measures. We
              conclude that binning succeeds in signiﬁcantly improving
              naive Bayesian probability estimates, while for improving
              decision tree probability estimates, we recommend smoothing
              by -estimation and a new variant of pruning that we call
              curtailment.},

              data (RWD) are available in greater quantity and scope than
              ever before. Since the 2016 United States 21st Century
              Cures Act, innovations in the RWD life cycle have taken
              tremendous strides forward, largely driven by demand for
              regulatory-grade real-world evidence from the
              biopharmaceutical sector. However, use cases for RWD
              continue to grow in number, moving beyond drug development,
              to population health and direct clinical applications
              pertinent to payors, providers, and health systems.
              Effective RWD utilization requires disparate data sources
              to be turned into high-quality datasets. To harness the
              potential of RWD for emerging use cases, providers and
              organizations must accelerate life cycle improvements that
              support this process. We build on examples obtained from
              the academic literature and author experience of data
              curation practices across a diverse range of sectors to
              describe a standardized RWD life cycle containing key steps
              in production of useful data for analysis and insights. We
              delineate best practices that will add value to current
              data pipelines. Seven themes are highlighted that ensure
              sustainability and scalability for RWD life cycles: data
              standards adherence, tailored quality assurance, data entry
              incentivization, deploying natural language processing,
              data platform solutions, RWD governance, and ensuring

  abstract = {High resolution clinical databases from electronic health
              records are increasingly being used in the field of health
              data science. Compared to traditional administrative
              databases and disease registries, these newer highly
              granular clinical datasets offer several advantages,
              including availability of detailed clinical information for
              machine learning and the ability to adjust for potential
              confounders in statistical models. The purpose of this
              study is to compare the analysis of the same clinical
              research question using an administrative database and an
              electronic health record database. The Nationwide Inpatient
              Sample (NIS) was used for the low-resolution model, and the
              eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU) was used for
              the high-resolution model. A parallel cohort of patients
              admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with sepsis and
              requiring mechanical ventilation was extracted from each
              database. The primary outcome was mortality and the
              exposure of interest was the use of dialysis. In the low
              resolution model, after controlling for the covariates that
              are available, dialysis use was associated with an
              increased mortality (eICU: OR 2.07, 95\% CI
              1.75â€“2.44, p{\textless}0.01; NIS: OR 1.40, 95\% CI
              1.36â€“1.45, p{\textless}0.01). In the high-resolution
              model, after the addition of the clinical covariates, the
              harmful effect of dialysis on mortality was no longer
              significant (OR 1.04, 95\% 0.85â€“1.28, p = 0.64). The
              results of this experiment show that the addition of high
              resolution clinical variables to statistical models
              significantly improves the ability to control for important
              confounders that are not available in administrative
              datasets. This suggests that the results from prior studies
              using low resolution data may be inaccurate and may need to
              be repeated using detailed clinical data.},
