                dramatic transformation taking place in health informatics

                Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ({FHIR})
                standard. The first article provided background on health
                care, electronic health record systems for physicians, and
                the challenges they both face along with the potential of
                interoperability to help overcome them. The second
                introduced the basics of the {FHIR} standard and some
                suggested resources for those who are interested in its
                further exploration. The third introduced {SMART} on {FHIR}
                which, based on its wide adoption, has become the default
                standard {FHIR} app platform. The fourth looked at clinical
                decision support, arguably the single most important
                providerfacing use case for {FHIR}. The fifth introduced
                the personal health record and tools that can utilize the
                data stored in it as an important use case for {FHIR} in
                support of patients. This article looks at the future uses
                of {FHIR} with a particular emphasis on those that might
                impact on research uses of health data. The articles in

  title    = {Characterizing clinical pediatric obesity subtypes using
              electronic health record data},
  volume   = {1},
  abstract = {In this work, we present a study of electronic health
              record (EHR) data that aims to identify pediatric obesity
              clinical subtypes. Specifically, we examine whether certain
              temporal condition patterns associated with childhood
              obesity incidence tend to cluster together to characterize
              subtypes of clinically similar patients. In a previous
              study, the sequence mining algorithm, SPADE was implemented
              on EHR data from a large retrospective cohort (n = 49 594
              patients) to identify common condition trajectories
              surrounding pediatric obesity incidence. In this study, we
              used Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to identify potential
              subtypes formed by these temporal condition patterns. The
              demographic characteristics of patients in each subtype are
              also examined. An LCA model with 8 classes was developed
              that identified clinically similar patient subtypes.
              Patients in Class 1 had a high prevalence of respiratory
              and sleep disorders, patients in Class 2 had high rates of
              inflammatory skin conditions, patients in Class 3 had a
              high prevalence of seizure disorders, and patients in Class
              4 had a high prevalence of Asthma. Patients in Class 5
              lacked a clear characteristic morbidity pattern, and
              patients in Classes 6, 7, and 8 had a high prevalence of
              gastrointestinal issues, neurodevelopmental disorders, and
              physical symptoms respectively. Subjects generally had high
              membership probability for a single class
              ({\textgreater}70\%), suggesting shared clinical
              characterization within the individual groups. We
              identified patient subtypes with temporal condition
              patterns that are significantly more common among obese
              pediatric patients using a Latent Class Analysis approach.
              Our findings may be used to characterize the prevalence of
              common conditions among newly obese pediatric patients and
              to identify pediatric obesity subtypes. The identified
              subtypes align with prior knowledge on comorbidities
              associated with childhood obesity, including
              gastro-intestinal, dermatologic, developmental, and sleep

                repeated outcomes and changing covariates) and different
                types of temporal association rules. Quantitative
                continuous variables can be discretized, as in clinical
                studies. The "book music" approach could become an
                intermediary step in feature extraction from structured
                data. It would enable to better account for time in
                analyses, notably for historical cohort analyses based on
                healthcare data reuse.},

  abstract = {Ideally, questions about comparative effectiveness or safety would be answered using an appropriately designed and conducted randomized experiment. When we cannot conduct a randomized experiment, we analyze observational data. Causal inference from large observational databases (big data) can be viewed as an attempt to emulate a randomized experiment—the target experiment or target trial—that would answer the question of interest. When the goal is to guide decisions among several strategies, causal analyses of observational data need to be evaluated with respect to how well they emulate a particular target trial. We outline a framework for comparative effectiveness research using big data that makes the target trial explicit. This framework channels counterfactual theory for comparing the effects of sustained treatment strategies, organizes analytic approaches, provides a structured process for the criticism of observational studies, and helps avoid common methodologic pitfalls.},

              {\textbackslash}phi-divergences and binary classification},
  abstract = {A class of distance measures on probabilities —the
              integral probability metrics ({IPMs}) — is addressed:
              these include the Wasserstein distance, Dudley metric, and
              Maximum Mean Discrepancy. {IPMs} have thus far mostly been
              used in more abstract settings, for instance as theoretical
              tools in mass transportation problems, and in metrizing the
              weak topology on the set of all Borel probability measures
              deﬁned on a metric space. Practical applications of
              {IPMs} are less common, with some exceptions in the kernel
              machines literature. The present work contributes a number
              of novel properties of {IPMs}, which should contribute to
              making {IPMs} more widely used in practice, for instance in
              areas where φ-divergences are currently popular.},

  abstract    = {L'apparition des dossiers patient informatisés et la collection croissante de données liées aux soins a permis l'émergence d'entrepôts de données pouvant être utilisés en recherche clinique pour identifier et retrouver les données liées à un groupe de patients. La plateforme i2b2 choisie ici est à la fois un entrepôt et un outil de requêtes, disponible sous licence open source. L'objectif était l'étude de la faisabilité du déploiement de la plateforme i2b2 au {CHRU} de Nancy, explorant la représentation et l'intégration des données du {SIH}, et les règles de gouvernance. Un package R (R2b2) a été développé spécifiquement, permettant de gérer l'entrepôt, manipuler et intégrer les données. Les sources de données existantes dans le {SIH} ont été étudiées pour leur intégration, et un modèle de représentation des données a été choisi (ou conçu lorsque cela était nécessaire) pour organiser les concepts. Un dispositif a été mis en place pour protéger l'accès aux données, en miroir de la responsabilité médicale au {CHRU} et respectant les règles de collection et d'accès aux données de soins, permettant un retour direct aux praticiens. Un prototype fonctionnel est fourni, intégrant les données de 118330 patients lors de 247580 hospitalisations depuis début 2016, totalisant plus de 18 millions d'observations. Le travail conduit autour de ce prototype a permis de dégager plusieurs axes de conduite pour la mise en production du projet, et les règles régissant les accès.},

  abstract  = {Randomized clinical trials (RCT) are the gold standard for informing treatment decisions. Observational studies are often plagued by selection bias, and expert-selected covariates may insufficiently adjust for confounding. We explore how unstructured clinical text can be used to reduce selection bias and improve medical practice. We develop a framework based on natural language processing to uncover interpretable potential confounders from text. We validate our method by comparing the estimated hazard ratio (HR) with and without the confounders against established RCTs. We apply our method to four cohorts built from localized prostate and lung cancer datasets from the Stanford Cancer Institute and show that our method shifts the HR estimate towards the RCT results. The uncovered terms can also be interpreted by oncologists for clinical insights. We present this proof-of-concept study to enable more credible causal inference using observational data, uncover meaningful insights from clinical text, and inform high-stakes medical decisions.},
